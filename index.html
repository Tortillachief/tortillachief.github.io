        <h2>My Personal Interests:</h2>
        <p>
            When I have a moment to myself (currently I'm going to school full-time and interning part-time) I very much enjoy graphic-design. Before I discovered programming I was majoring in animation and game design,
             which is where I acquired most of my artistic abilities. Currently I create designs and print them on wood with a laser engraver, and then subsequently sell them on etsy.com as a side-gig.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may seem weird that I'm taking my first web development class as a senior (believe me, I wish I had taken it much earlier in my college career) but for my capstone project I am developing an exercise oriented role-playing game.
            This has given me a chance to explore the unity game engine, and discover its capabilities. In my free time I'm attempting to recreate a board game from the 70's called dark tower in unity and hopefully publish it on the apple and android stores.
        </p>
        <p> 
            I play video-games on occassion. One of the many that I'm currently into is called <em>Escape from Tarkov.</em> It's a Mil-Sim (military simulation) first-person-shooter that focuses on realism. It implements realistic weapon ballistics (gravity, weather conditions,
             bullet velocity, etc.) The devs have licensed dozens of real-world weapons to allow them to be featured in their game as well as hundreds of weapon attachments for said weapons. It's a very complex game and isn't for everybody, but I enjoy it.
